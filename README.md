# BESTur
BLAST-Empowered Search Tool to find unique regions. It is a command pipeline we worte in Bash using bioinforatics armory such as: BLAST, Bowtie mapper, Cufflinks assembler and custom scripts in python to glue the BESTur pipeline. This pipeline is useful to discover unique regions in a query genome (i.e. a pathogen genome). We defined unique region of a genome as a subsequence of it that is absent or is very dissimilar to all possible subsequences of other species genomes.
